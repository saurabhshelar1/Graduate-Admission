### EDA on Admission dataset and making a predictive model which can predict chance of a student getting admission.
I found a this dataset on kaggle which has details of students like their 'GRE score', 'TOEFL Score',	'University Rating',	'Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength',	'LOR',	'CGPA',	'Research Experience' and	'Chance of Admit'. On this information I performed EDA to usnderstand it better and created the best suited predictive model according to me.
